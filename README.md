A Super Mario World romhack for learning the credits warp run

Inspired by a BizHawk script written by SethBling (featured in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPa-UNS2VSM)) this ROMhack assits in practicing the setup for the [Super Mario World Credits Warp Run](deanyd.net/smw/index.php?title=Credits_Warp_Run) ([mirror](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:y2k4BCmGTRQJ:deanyd.net/smw/index.php%3Ftitle%3DCredits_Warp_Run+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)).

The script reads a few sections of memory which are critical to the run and displays an X near the score counter when each part is set up properly.
